/* From http://www-theorie.physik.unizh.ch/~dpotter/howto/daemonize,
   released into the public domain.
   To properly daemonize, the following steps must be followed.
    * The fork() call is used to create a separate process.
 *    The setsid() call is used to detach the process from the
 *    parent (possibly a shell). The file mask should be reset.
    * The current directory should be changed to something benign.
    * The standard files (stdin,stdout and stderr) need to be reopened.

Failure to do any of these steps will lead to a daemon process that can
misbehave. The typical symptoms are as follows.

    * Starting the daemon and then logging out will cause the terminal to hang. This is particularly nasty with ssh.
    * The directory from which the daemon was launched remains locked.
    * Spurious output appears in the shell from which the daemon was started.

    CN - various changes made to this original code
 *  1) lock file not created by parent process as the lock
 *  appears not to be inherited by children across fork()
 *  2) fork called twice to properly isolate daemon. Don't
 *  really understand the need for this.
 *  3) pid file only opened/written by the daemon child.
 *  4) Daemon process signals intermediate process that all is
 *  OK. Intermediate child signals parent process.
        Otherwise, the parent sees SIGCHLD signal when intermediate process exits, and calls this a failure
        (non-zero exit code).
